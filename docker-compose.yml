# This setup creates a Tomcat container for the EARS webservices, a Tomcat containber for the acquisition module and a MySQL container. If this is the first run it populates it with the needed tables. 
# The computer they are run from is called the host.
# The tomcat container depends on the mysql one (see the depends_on keyword). 
# The tomcat main command (catalina.sh) is not run before the MySQL database is populated; this is done via the wait_for_mysql.sh script. 
# Both containers share the same IP address (localhost). This is done as localhost is hardcoded inside the swing java code 
# The SQL data is persisted outside of the MySQL container
# The 'restart: always' keywords ensure that both services are restarted always after each crash or system reboot, as long as the docker daemon is running. sudo docker stop <id> will actually stop the application, and it will not be restarted automatically.
# The container names are stored as ears-server_tomcat, ears-server_mysql and ears-server_acquisition. These can be used in your docker host to see the logs or get info: eg. sudo docker logs ears-server_acquisition or sudo docker inspect ears-server_mysql
# The EARS webservices are reachable on http://localhost and the acquisition server on http://localhost:8080
